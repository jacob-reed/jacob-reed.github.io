#### Porfolio 2018 (and beyond)
I've been meaning to create a space to share some of the things I've worked on. Although I'm not entirey sure what I'll do with this (or who will even see it), it's something I need to do to keep myself sharp as well as explore new ways to create on the web. If you've found this page, don't be too harsh with judgement -- this isn't something that has my undivided attention!

- [ ] Finish building responsive grid system in HTML
- [ ] Utilize SASS for page styling
- [ ] Explore options for flair with JS
- [ ] Create actual content! (You'd think this would be higher up there...)
- [ ] Create sub-pages for each project
- [ ] Keep site updated with progress (My greatest challenge yet!)
