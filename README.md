### The beginning of something great.
***
I've been meaning to getting around to creating a space to find some of the things I've worked on. Although I'm not entirey sure what I'll do with this (or who will even see it), it's something I need to do to keep myself sharp as well as explore new ways to create on the web. If you've found this page, don't be too harsh with judgement -- this isn't something that has my undivided attention!
